# Unity WebGL Implementation Plan for GPTamagotchi (Future Phase)

## Migration Overview

This document outlines the plan for migrating from the initial React + Tailwind MVP to a Unity WebGL implementation for a more immersive experience. The migration will happen after validating core functionality and user engagement in the web-based MVP.

```
[Initial MVP]                         [Future Implementation]
[React + Tailwind] -> Migration -> [Unity WebGL Frontend] 
      |                                     |
      v                                     v
[Backend Services] <---------------> [Backend Services]
      |                                     |
      v                                     v

```

## 1. Pre-Migration Requirements

Before beginning the Unity implementation, ensure:
- Core AI functionality is stable in the React MVP
- User engagement metrics meet targets
- Memory system is functioning properly
- Key pain points and improvement areas are identified

## 2. Unity Project Setup

### Development Environment
- Unity 2022.3 LTS (or latest stable)
- WebGL Build Support module
- C# scripting
- Blender 3.6+ for asset creation

### Project Structure
- `/Assets/Models` - 3D character models and environments
- `/Assets/Animations` - Animation clips for character states
- `/Assets/Scripts` - C# code organized by functionality
- `/Assets/Prefabs` - Reusable UI and game components
- `/Assets/Scenes` - Main scene and any additional scenes

## 3. Character Design & Animation

### Blender Asset Creation
- Design modular character with customizable features
- Create base model with well-defined animation rig
- Design facial expressions for different emotional states:
  - Happy, sad, curious, confused, excited, etc.
- Develop animation states for:
  - Idle (multiple variations)
  - Listening (attentive poses)
  - Thinking (processing user input)
  - Speaking (with lip sync capability)
  - Transitional animations between states

### Unity Implementation
- Import character from Blender preserving rigging
- Set up Animation Controller with states and transitions
- Implement blend trees for emotional dimensions
- Create runtime animation control system
- Integrate LipSync package for audio synchronization

## 4. Voice & Chat UI Integration

### Voice Recording
- Implement WebGL-compatible microphone access
- Add visual recording indicators and feedback
- Create audio buffer management system
- Handle browser permissions gracefully
- Implement fallback options for unsupported browsers

### Chat Interface
- Design 3D-integrated chat UI elements
- Create speech bubble system with timed display
- Implement scrolling chat history
- Add visual typing indicators
- Support text input as fallback option

## 5. Backend Communication

### API Integration
- Create API service layer in C#
- Implement REST client for backend communication
- Design serialization/deserialization for API objects
- Add request queuing and retry logic
- Implement authentication token management

### Data Flow
- Voice recording → Audio buffer → Backend
- Text response → Animation trigger + Speech synthesis
- Emotional state updates → Animation parameter changes
- Memory recall visualization (optional feature)

## 6. Emotion Visualization System

### Emotional State Representation
- Map emotional dimensions to visual cues:
  - Happiness: Posture, expression, environment color
  - Connection: Proximity, eye contact, animation warmth
  - Curiosity: Head tilts, looking behavior, movement
- Create smooth transitions between emotional states
- Develop environmental responses to emotional shifts

### Emotional Intelligence Features
- Visual reactions to user sentiment
- Idle animations that reflect current emotional state
- Progressive relationship indicators (environment changes)
- Non-verbal cues during conversation (nodding, etc.)

## 7. Memory Visualization

- Create visual memory journal/scrapbook interface
- Design thought bubble system for memory recall moments
- Implement visual indicators when accessing memories
- Add memory strength visualization system

## 8. WebGL Optimization

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize model polygon count (<50k polygons)
- Use efficient texture atlasing
- Implement LOD (Level of Detail) for different devices
- Minimize garbage collection with object pooling
- Optimize animation blend tree complexity

### WebGL-Specific Considerations
- Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Implement progressive loading for assets
- Add compressed texture support
- Create loading screen with progress indicators
- Handle audio constraints across browsers

## 9. Testing & Deployment

### Testing Plan
- Cross-browser functionality testing
- Performance profiling on different devices
- Animation transition quality assurance
- API integration testing
- Voice recording quality testing

### Deployment
- Configure Unity WebGL build settings
- Set up compression options
- Create build pipeline for CI/CD
- Document browser requirements
- Prepare fallback content for unsupported browsers

## 10. Migration Strategy

### Data Migration
- Ensure user data from React MVP transfers seamlessly
- Migrate existing user profiles and memory content
- Preserve emotional state progression
- Import conversation history

### User Transition
- Provide clear communication about the upgrade
- Offer side-by-side access during transition
- Gather feedback on the new experience
- Provide documentation on new features

## 11. Timeline & Milestones

### Pre-Development Phase (1-2 weeks)
- Analyze React MVP performance and user feedback
- Finalize 3D character design and requirements
- Document API specifications for Unity integration
- Set up development environments

### Development Phase (6-8 weeks)
- Week 1-2: Set up Unity project with WebGL template
- Week 3-4: Implement character model, animations, and basic scene
- Week 5-6: Integrate API communication and voice systems
- Week 7-8: Polish, optimize, and test for deployment

### Testing & Migration Phase (2-3 weeks)
- Alpha testing with internal team
- Beta testing with select users
- Data migration testing
- Performance optimization
- Final deployment and user transition

## 12. Resource Requirements

### Team Skills Needed
- Unity developer with C# experience
- 3D artist proficient in Blender
- UI/UX designer for game interfaces
- Backend developer for API integration

### Asset Requirements
- Character model and animations
- UI elements and icons
- Environment assets
- Audio effects

## 13. Future Expansion Possibilities
